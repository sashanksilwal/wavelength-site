Some sort of verification would be good to make sure everyone feels safe. Group settings with multiple people may be better. I’d only use this app to find people to play pickleball, tennis, ping pong, or another sport with. Not a general hang out app unless it’s a dating app.

I strongly discourage the use of AI for any front-end user elements.
